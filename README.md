### Description

Sends beeps through the internal PC speaker. Some programs work with NT but not Win9x, others work with Win9x but not NT. This program works with either. It has been tested on Win95, 98, Me, and NT 4.0 systems. Should work with 2000 as well, don't know about WinXp.

There is a module that tests for which operating system is present, and uses the appropriate code to beep the internal speaker. The Win9x code was adapted from code written by Jorge Loubet. It requires the presence of Win95io.dll which can be downloaded from http://www.softcircuits.com.
